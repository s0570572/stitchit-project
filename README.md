# Stitchit!-project
This is a one-page web application where you can share links to cross-stitching schemes for free.

There is a home page welcoming the users, an about page with a bit more information about the app, and a gallery where you can find the already posted entries. If you click on the Add button in the upper right corner of your screen, you come to the form allowing you to post a new entry. Upon posting it, you are redirected to a page telling you about the operation success. (Validation - in progress)

In the gallery you can switch between different topics and choose between three difficulty levels - functionality in progress.

You can also delete an entry - as of now, any entry, functionality in progress.
